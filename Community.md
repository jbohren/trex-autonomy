## Willow Garage ##
[Willow Garage](http://www.willowgarage.com) has been using TREX to demonstrate robust autonomy in the domain of mobile manipulation. TREX has been integrated with the [ROS](http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/ROS) platform.
[Here](http://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2009/06/03/watch-milestone-2) is an example of T-REX controlling a [PR2](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/robots/pr2-overview) to navigate, open doors, and plug itself in.

## The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ##
TREX was first developed at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](http://www.mbari.org/) where it is used to control [Autonomous Underwater Vehicles](http://www.mbari.org/AUV/) for oceanographic research.
[This page](http://www.mbari.org/autonomy/TREX/index.htm) tracks the history and ongoing activities of that effort.
